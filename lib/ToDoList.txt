* Remove trigger entity
* Fix changeD right screen
* Study collision/fix bullets

* Set up multiple enemies
* Add enemy fire
* Add player collision with fire
* correct explosion position
* Add player explosion, then delay for time and regenrate. Likely will need a "ghost phase, so that player can reposition". May want to use different states as in jumpnrun example.
* Limit player bullets to 3 then pause and allow more bullets
* Director: return false if append didn't work
- Consider removing lives from playerSHip
* Reduce lives after player dies. Check for end of game.
* Add player ships remaining
* Add title screen
* Add scoring
* Need to ensure enemies kill player when player is struck
* Base ship needs multiple explosions and timer to delay level complete until after it is completely destroyed.
* Add player rank
* Make levels loop after completing. 
* Add transition "scenes" between levels with reference to player rank.
* Create 5 different levels
- Repeat 5 levels with increasing difficulty
- Maybe add sound
